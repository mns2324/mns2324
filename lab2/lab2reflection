1. What inspired your branding?

Since coding environments are often dark mode, I went with a branding style that would fit within those environments. This is apparent with the design of GitHub which in my opinion, deliberately uses dark and cold characters to be easier on the eyes of programmers, especially those that spend a lot of time in front of their monitor or laptop screen.

2. How did you choose your palette?

Since I already chose black/gray colors, I decided to go with my favorite color which is blue to help text pop out from the black background.

3. What was challenging in creating the logo?

Making sure the design wasn't too much or too little. Since is my first time attempting to make any kind of logo for personal branding, I would say the logo looks somewhat basic in its current form. However, attempting is better than not trying at all.

4. How do you plan to use this branding in future projects?

I plan on either expanding, reworking or using it as inspiration for future branding as this is my first experience in actually creating my own self branding using what I have learned now and in the past.
