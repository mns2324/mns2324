1. Which design was the easiest?
The banner was the easiest as I already had an existing design for it.

2. What branding elements were applied?
I applied my color scheme (blues, blacks, grays) as well as my typefaces when creating these designs.

3. How did you ensure readability and hierarchy?
I ensured proper negative space around elements. I made sure which elements needed to stand out such 
text and images by making their colors brighter or their size larger. I also needed to ensure that
the flow made sense, designing it in a way that would make the viewers go from top to bottom as planned.

4. What did you learn about creating social media graphics?
It will take a lot of time if you are someone who hasn't been creating or isn't used to creating
these kinds of graphics. You will have to think like a social media manager, knowing what will 
catch the attention of your followers while still staying within the realm of your branding.
