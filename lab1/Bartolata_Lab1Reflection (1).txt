1. What design principle did you find most useful?

I found contrast and alignment useful as they help the presentation look clean and improve its visual clarity by making the important bits like text pop out more compared to the rest of the presentation.

2. What part of Canva was easiest/hardest to use?
The easiest part to use was the elements tab as you can search for lots of design elements very quickly. The hardest part was mostly remembering other useful features that you could do such as stretching images.

3. What did you learn about visual communication?

Sleek design is crucial for visual communication as it is the hook that will catch the attention of your viewers. If the design is too disorganized, esoteric or wordy, most people would lose interest or find it hard to focus on it. You need your design to be comfortable enough to look at while also being exciting.
